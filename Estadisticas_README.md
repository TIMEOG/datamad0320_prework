Hola, soy Alvaro. 

He organizado las pruebas por semanas. 
En algunas pruebas, donde he logrado un 100% de acierto, sólo subo este pantallazo.
En las pruebas donde he cometido errores, subo el resultado (siempre > 75% de acierto), y además los errores que hubiera cometido, para de esta manera saber qué temas tengo que repasar/reforzar.
